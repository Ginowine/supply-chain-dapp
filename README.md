# Supply Chain Smart Contracts

A supply chain is the network of all the individuals, organizations, resources, activities, and technology involved in the creation and sale of a product.
A supply chain encompasses everything from the delivery of source materials from the supplier to the manufacturer through to its eventual delivery to the end user.

## Problem

We have the following problems when managing the traditional supply chain process of a product

- Not being able to verify information about a product
- Not being able to access information on companies and suppliers in the supply chain process
- Not being able to ascertain the safety and quality of products
- Product traceability of products issue
- Ethics and compliance issues

## Smart Contract Solution

Create a smart contract solution that can be deployed to the Ethereum and Rootstock network. This smart contract application provides the following functionalities
